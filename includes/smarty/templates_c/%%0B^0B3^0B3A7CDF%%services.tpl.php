<td width="52%" class="content pad"><div id="services">PeopleU can help you break your production bottlenecks in IT. That's how we started! It's all in <a href="javascript:object.getData('aboutus','&amp;flag=1');" class="line">Our  Story</a>. Our parent company, U,  Inc. was not able to ramp up their sales without being able to quickly and effectively add programmers to meet demand. After setting up an overseas office, we began to see the effects of global sourcing, and how much it was improving our throughput as well as our  sales ability. We want to share that  with other companies and shed the handcuffs technology can put on all of us. <br/><br/>
    <a href="Javascript:object.setShowHide('aug|services|project|process|cad',this);" class="line">Augmentation</a> is our favorite model, because that means we're  working with a savvy company who understands project management and IT  practices, but either can't find the programmers locally or needs to expand  their development beyond the 8 hour work day. <br/>
  It's  true that we also do some  <a href="javascript:object.setShowHide('project|services|aug|process|cad',this);" class="line">project work</a>,  however, we're picky. If it's a project, <a href="javascript:object.getData('contact','&amp;flag=1');" class="line">contact us</a> and let us know what it is  that you're looking for. We might be  interested…or we might refer you to one of several development firms that we  work with. <br/><br/>

  Our  IT specialists work on various platforms to provide application development,  website design, and database management. We can help you with:
<ul class="list">
  <li>.NET</li>
  <li>Java</li>
  <li>PHP</li>
  <li>Flash/Actionscript</li>
  <li>Graphic design</li>
</ul>
Want  something else? C++? Python? ColdFusion? Cobol? Just ask. At PeopleU, we find the people you need!<br/>

</div>
    <div id="aug" style="display:none;"><span class="heading"><strong>Breaking Bottlenecks (Video Script)</strong></span>
    <div class="sub_heading">Augmentation</div>
  Augmentation  is the best and least expensive way to use global sourcing to your  advantage. If you know what you want,  know how to provide a scope of work, and have the right person in the US to manage  an overseas team, then augmentation is a beautiful thing!<br/><br/>

  We  want to work with savvy companies who know what the heck they're doing. Working with PeopleU to augment your existing  staff means:
<ul class="list">
  <li>You increase your production team (programming, CAD,  design, research, etc. )</li>
  <li>You increase throughput and reduce cycle time by working  16-24 hours rather than 8 hours a day</li>
  <li>You retain control over your projects by managing  your team</li>
  <li>You cut out middle management and get directly to  the developers</li>
</ul>
Typically,  we can provide a team of 3-5 people in our overseas office for the price of one  here. We take care of recruiting and  hiring, salaries, taxes, management, computers, benefits, and provide a great  work environment for your team. You take  care of managing your team and keeping them busy. <br/><br/>

  Don't  let production own you. Own production  by having a team specifically assembled for your company's needs.  </div>
  <div id="project" style="display:none;">
  <div class="sub_heading" >Projects</div>
  Do  you have an idea for a web-based system that's going to revolutionize lives,  business, the world, or something even bigger than the world?  Then we're <em>very</em> interested in hearing  about your project!<br/><br/>

  If  it's something not quite as grandiose, that's okay too. We'll look at about anything. But if it's not something that is of interest  to us, we know a lot of firms (many of whom have teams of programmers in our  overseas offices) that we can refer you to. We only refer people to firms that we know will stand behind their work,  just like we do. <br/><br/>

  When  we work on projects, we typically use both US and overseas programmers to plan,  scope, design, and develop your system. This helps get your project finished faster and still keeps your price  down. <br/><br/>

  But  please don't be offended if we refer you elsewhere…even if you think your  system is earth shaking, never-been-done-before kind of stuff. It just means that it's not a project we feel  comfortable managing, and that's a good thing. You should <em>want </em>to work with people who will be honest and always  send you in the right direction. </div>
 <div id="process" style="display:none;">
   <div class="sub_heading">The Process</div>

  Whether  you need PHP, .NET, Java, CAD, Revit, Inventor, Perl, researchers, data mining,  or a team that can make the tastiest tandoori chicken this side of the  subcontinent, the process is always the same. <br/><br/>

  We  will do a full evaluation of your company's needs, and regardless of whether  you think you want an augmentation team or project work, we will evaluate what  is the best fit for your company. Our  goal is quality, so we will give you an honest evaluation of what will be most  successful for your organization (but the customer is always right, so you can  still overrule us). <br/><br/>

  If  it is determined that a team will fit you best, we will fully explain the pros  and cons of working with an overseas team. The key to your success in augmentation will always be the person in the  US who is  communicating with the overseas team. If  you have the right person for that role (we call this person the "Champion"),  you are 90% of the way there. If it's a  project, Champions do not apply and this paragraph may be stricken from the  record. <br/><br/>

  We  will evaluate our existing staff members to determine whether we have the right  people in place or if we need to hire someone, then we will begin to put that  team together. <br/><br/>

  During  that time we will provide you with some eLearning courses that we have created  to help set expectations and clearly explain to you and your Champion when and  how best to communicate with your team. 
As a famous person once said, "Follow PeopleU's  process and your odds of success go WAY up!"</div>
