  They  all essentially mean the same thing...you're trying to find the right people to  get the work done. The only variables in  the decision are <em>who, where, </em>and <em>how much</em>. <br/><br />

  PeopleU  can help by providing affordable onshore and offshore development solutions, as  well as determining what's right for your company. The last thing we want is a customer who  didn't really need our services in the first place. That's not good for anyone involved!<br/><br />

  Yes,  we work with some Fortune 500 companies, but one of the things we love the most  is making global sourcing an option for small and mid-size businesses who did  not realize they could afford or manage to work overseas. To stay competitive in today's marketplace,  you have to be global, no matter your size. <br/><br />

  Talk  to us today about our <u>augmentation</u> and <u>project</u> models. We'll shoot you straight, and help you rock that work out like never  before!</div>
<div id="global_1" style="display:none;">
<div class="sub_heading">Small and Mid-Size Businesses</div>

  If  we hear another business say, "We're too small to use global development  teams," we're gonna break something!<br/>
  When  our parent company, <u>U, Inc. </u>, couldn't  find the programmers they needed to meet market demand, they set out on an  expensive experiment to find talented, dedicated overseas developers. As a  small company, a failed experiment could have seriously hurt the  organization. Instead, it was a glowing  success that broke the company's production bottlenecks, and let them focus on  sales and marketing! (find out more about <u>our story</u>) <br/><br />

  If  we could do it, so can you. But rather  than try to negotiate your way through a foreign environment alone, we can make  the whole process easy. The whole reason  that PeopleU exists is because global sourcing worked for our small business,  and we want it to work for other small and mid-size businesses as well. <br/><br />

  All  those horror stories you've heard about companies that have been burned going  overseas are true. It's because they  worked with foreign companies that did not care about quality or long term  relationships. At PeopleU, we care as  much about your quality as we do our own. <br/><br />

  As  we always say, our reputation is too valuable to tarnish. We would rather turn down a sale or bend over  backwards to help our customers than hurt our standing in the community and in  our clients' eyes. So give us a call and  let's explore the opportunity that the global market has for your company. It's amazing what you'll find out!Â

<div id="global_2" style="display:none; vertical-align:top;">
<div class="sub_heading">If You're Not Global, You're Dead</div>
  I'm  sure there's a nicer way to say this, but come on. Let's be honest. Companies do business on a global scale now,  and if you don't, then your competition is itching to use that competitive  advantage against you. <br/><br />

  Manufacturing,  software development, customer service, CAD design, R&amp;D, transcription, and  even surgery are being done by overseas organizations. It speeds up production, provides new  efficiencies, and helps companies outbid their competitors. <br/><br />

  So  whatever the size of your business, stay competitive. We can offer you the opportunity to beat your  competition to the punch!<br />
