	<td width="52%" class="content pad"> <div id="about">Our parent company, U, Inc., was founded in 1999 by my father, Lirel Holt, and myself. Today U, Inc. provides eLearning and online event registration to more than 15,000 businesses, schools, and non-profit organizations across North America. Our systems are used by more than half a million people annually, and it is unbelievably important to us to provide high quality web-based systems.<br/> <br/> 

In 2002, we tried sending a software development project overseas. It failed. Miserably. Poor communication, and a lack of care from the developer's side doomed the project. We nearly swore off overseas development then and there.<br/><br/> 
But in 2005, we had to re-evaluate, because we could not get the development done fast enough to keep up with our customers' needs. We were unable to find enough programming talent in the Kansas City area. We had no ability to expand beyond the typical 8 hour work day to increase our throughput.<br/><br/>
Not only that, we started losing our existing programmers as they job hopped. As a small company, we knew we had to do something if we wanted to continue to grow and stay competitive.<br/><br/>

So we put together a team that went overseas and set up offices in China and India. Today, the majority of U, Inc.'s development is done in coordination between our office in Kansas City and our office in Chennai, India. Not only did we break our production bottleneck, we were able to increase our focus on sales and marketing, with a capability to scale development quickly to match our needs.<br/>
<br/> 
It wasn't long before other companies heard about our success. Many had tried working overseas, but failed. The prospect of working with a US company that cared about their quality, and the ability to use the systems we had in place was very attractive.<br/>
<br/> 
Each month we add new augmentation teams and develop projects in our overseas office, and our customers love it. Whether it's CAD detailing, research and data mining, or software development, they're saying the same things we are. "We broke our bottleneck, and I can sleep at night knowing I have the staff to get the work out the door!"<br/>
<br/>
 Give us a call. I'm telling you, it will change the way you do business!<br/>

  <div class="sub_heading">What's Important?</div>
   What's important to you? 
   <ul class="list"> 
   <li>Having a programming team you can depend on, rather than the one guy who you fear could leave at any time?</li> 
   <li>Knowing you can find the people you need, even though your competitor sucks up all the talent in your market?</li> <li>Knowing you can meet or beat your customer's deadline?</li> 
   <li>Being able to ramp up production for a short period of time without having to hire full time employees?</li> <li>Being able to develop around the clock rather than just 8 hours a day?
   </li> 
   </ul> 
   If any of these are important to you…if they're keeping you awake at night…call us.  Life's too short to keep worrying when any of these can be easily solved.<br/><br/>

    <ul class="list"> 
    <li>PeopleU is like a consultative, staff searching, IT, CAD, research, design, development and support team that really loves breaking bottlenecks (how is that for an elevator speech?)</li> 
    <li>PeopleU and our overseas office are both subsidiaries of U, Inc., a US-owned and operated company</li>
    <li>We are headquartered in Kansas…and we love it here!</li>
    <li>The key to success with your overseas team is having the right Champion here in the US to manage your international team</li> 
    <li>Yes, security of your intellectual property is something you should consider when working overseas.  You should also consider that when working with your staff in the U.S.  We can help you on both accounts</li> 
    <li>We love finding a great project that interests us.  We also love referring great projects to our friendly development firms.  We want your project done and done right</li> 
    <li>There are only four common words in the English language that do not rhyme - purple, orange, silver, and month.  This is our president's second favorite weird fact</li> 
    <li><strong>Anyone can win, but not everyone will call.  So call us and let's talk.  Why not give it a try! </strong></li>
